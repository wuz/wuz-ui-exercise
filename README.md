[See the running app here](https://fervent-agnesi-b92cfa.netlify.app/)

## Project Goals

- [x] Uses color scheme similar to that of Gmail
- [x] Displays a list of emails with name, title, date and tags based on provided emails.json file
- [x] Allows for selection of one or more emails by the end user
- [x] Allows users to perform a number of actions on one or more selected emails
- [x] Shows a sidebar that displays a number of tags
- [x] Table cells should be viewable at all resolutions above 320px
- [x] Include at least one javascript test

There were a few things I didn't quite get to:
- Error handling for the "api"
- Building out the pages for archived and deleted mails
- Filters for the tags
- Actions on the email preview view
- More tests

## Run it locally

```
git clone https://github.com/wuz/wuz-ui-exercise # clone the project
cd wuz-ui-exercise # cd to the folder
yarn # install the dependencies
yarn run # run the app
```

This should automatically open the app for you, but otherwise it should be available on https://localhost:3000
